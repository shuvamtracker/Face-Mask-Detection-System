PROTOTXT:
 A prototype machine learning model created for use with Caffe.
 Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) is a deep
 learning framework that allows users to create image classification and image segmentation models.

CAFFEMODEL:
A file is a machine learning model created by Caffe. It contains an image 
classification or image segmentation model that has been trained using Caffe.
